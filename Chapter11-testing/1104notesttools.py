# to perform load testing, we must first identify the performance critical scenarios and the metrics which fulfill our performance objectives. Thypical criteria include:
# 1. response time
# 2. throughput
# 3. resource utilization
# 4. maximum load that the system can bear
# In the absense of formal testing tools, we could create our own. For example, we could simulate concurrent users by creating thousands of vitual users. We would 
# write a multi-threaded program with thousands of threads, where each thread acts as a real-world user loading the page. For each user, we would 
# programmatically measure response time, data I/O, etc.
# We would then analyze the results based on the data gathered during the tests and compare it with the accepted values.
