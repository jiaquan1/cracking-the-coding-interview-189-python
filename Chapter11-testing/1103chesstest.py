# random crashes:
# 1. Random variable
# 2. Uninitialized variable (could use runtime tools to check)
# 3. Memory leak
# 4. External dependencies
# To tracking the issue, learning as much as possible about the application, check components or scenarios. Try to test every case and eliminate several possibilities.
